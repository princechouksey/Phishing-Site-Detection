  "verdict": "Phishing",
  "explanation": "Content associated with illegal streaming/download sites frequently uses aggressive, intrusive, and potentially malicious advertising (malvertising) leading to scams, malware, or phishing pages. The presence of numerous third-party ad/tracking scripts, particularly those associated with intrusive overlays and suspicious redirects (`shotgunchancecruel.com`, `calmbytedishwater.com`, `cleverwebserver.com`), and push notification prompts strongly indicates a high risk of deceptive practices and exposure to phishing attempts or malware."
